## Why SoniqStem?

SoniqStem AI is not just another audio tool. It's a localized powerhouse for music producers, DJs, and content creators. We leverage state-of-the-art AI models to deconstruct audio and reconstruct distinct sonic elements.

### Features

#### 1. Ultimate Stem Separator
*Powered by Meta's Demucs v4 Hybrid Transformer*
Stop struggling with EQ. Extract studio-quality stems from any mixed track in seconds.
- **Micro-Surgical Precision:** Cleanly isolates **Vocals** from the **Instrumental**.
- **Dual Engine:** Supports local file uploads (WAV/MP3/FLAC) and direct YouTube URL processing.
- **High Fidelity:** Outputs pure 24-bit WAV for maximum localized quality.

#### 2. Voice Lab Lite
*DSP-Based Vocal Shapeshifter*
Transform the timbre and gender of any vocal track instantly without quality loss.
- **Gender Swapping:** Morph Male vocals to Female (and vice-versa) with formant-preserving pitch shifting.
- **Zero Latency DSP:** Uses `Librosa` for artifact-free signal processing.
- **Safe & Fast:** Runs 100% locally on your machine. No cloud uploads, no privacy risks.
